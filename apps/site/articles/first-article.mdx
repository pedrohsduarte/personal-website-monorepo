# Getting Started with Next.js and MDX

Welcome to my first article! Today, we're going to explore the powerful combination of Next.js and MDX.

## What is Next.js?

Next.js is a React framework that enables functionality such as server-side rendering and generating static websites. It's a popular choice for building modern web applications.

## What is MDX?

MDX allows you to use JSX in your markdown content. It's a powerful way to add dynamic content and components to your otherwise static markdown.

### Here's a simple example:

```jsx
function Highlight({ children }) {
  return <span style={{ backgroundColor: "yellow" }}>{children}</span>;
}

This is a <Highlight>highlighted text</Highlight> using a custom React component.
```

## Why use Next.js with MDX?

1. **Server-side rendering**: Next.js can render MDX content on the server, improving performance and SEO.
2. **Static site generation**: You can pre-render MDX pages at build time.
3. **Dynamic imports**: Easily import and use React components in your markdown.

## Code Example

Here's a simple React component written in JSX:

```jsx
import React from "react";

const Greeting = ({ name }) => {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
};

export default Greeting;
```

## Interactive Component

Here's an example of an interactive component in MDX:

import { useState } from "react";

export const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
};

<Counter />

## Conclusion

Next.js and MDX provide a powerful toolset for creating dynamic, content-driven websites. With the ability to mix markdown and React components, you can create rich, interactive content easily.

Happy coding!
